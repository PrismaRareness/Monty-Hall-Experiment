# Monty Hall Experiment

The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle named after Monty Hall, the original host of the TV show Let’s Make a Deal. It’s a famous paradox that has a solution that is so absurd, most people refuse to believe it’s true.
The program simulates this problem over and over again. After door 3 is opened, you'll think you have two doors to choose from... both with the same probabilities. However, it is very likely that you will learn to change.

- Who switched doors won about 2/3 of the time

- Those who didn't trade winning about 1/3 of the time

This fact was verified with a simulation.
